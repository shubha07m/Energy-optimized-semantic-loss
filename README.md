Semantic communication is about sending meaningful and efficient information, not just random data. It's good because it makes communication faster and uses less power. This study introduces a method called 'Energy-Optimized Semantic Loss' (EOSL) that saves energy while keeping communication working well. It's a step towards greener technology.
