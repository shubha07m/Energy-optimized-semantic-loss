In this short project I am doing some experimentation with various image to text and text to image transformer models. The initial goal is to research the effect of model selection on semantic understanding. In similarity_testing I have shown how having and not having a background and selection of different pre-trained transformer model can affect the similarity comparison of two images of a similar object. Two different similarity metrices, namely cosine similarity and structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) have been chosen for this.
